/* 
    53. Maximum Subarray

    Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray(containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and
    return its sum.

    Example:

    Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4],
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6.

    If you have figured out the O(n) solution,
    try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
